## Data Strategy
# Two collections: Users and Files

Each File Document will contain the Users ID and its own unique File ID and the associated metadata. 

Each User document will contains a list of associated file ID's, and the uploaders account information.


App.py contains the sample of the flask application that will run on aws and accept the API commands.
